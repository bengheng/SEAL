This set of instructions allow you to create a SEAL account for generating aliases to be distributed to your contacts. You will be able to reply to the emails via authenticated SMTP.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
To use the advance features, SEAL requires the email account to support sending emails via authenticated SMTP. <a
href="https://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a> provides such a facility and we will use
Gmail as an example in the instructions. Thus, you should create a new
Gmail account <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount">here</a>.

<h2>Setting Up a SEAL Account</h2>
<p>Setting up a SEAL account can be done in 3 easy steps.</p><br>
