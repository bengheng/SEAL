<h3>Step 2: Start using SEAL</h3>
<hr/><br>

<p>To start using SEAL, you need to create aliases for distribution to your
contacts.</p><br>

<h4>Creating an Alias (without sending any messages)</h4>
<p>
Once the above steps have been completed, you can create unrestricted
semi-private aliases for distribution to your contacts.<br>
<ol>
<li><a href="index.php">Login</a> to your SEAL account.</li>
<li>Click "Get Alias" on the menu on the right.</li>
<li>Enter the alias you want and click the "Get Alias!" button.</li>
</ol>
</p><br>

Emails sent to the created alias will be relayed to your email address. <font
color="red"><b>Note that replying to these emails is meaningless. Your
recipients will never receive your replies!</b></font>
