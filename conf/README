You can use the example configuration files in this directory as a starting
point for Dovecot and Postfix. You should review the contents of the
configuration files to make sure the values are appropriate, especially the file
paths.

Place "dovecot.conf" and "dovecot-sqlite.conf" in Dovecot's configuration
directory, e.g., "/etc/dovecot/".

Place "main.cf" and "master.cf" in Postfix's configuration directory, e.g.,
"/etc/postfix/".
