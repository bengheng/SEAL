SEAL uses two SQLite databases: "cloakdb" and "logdb". "cloakdb" is generated
from "schema.sql". It contains the main tables storing the aliases,
correspondence histories, etc. On the other hand, "logdb" is generated from
"log_schema.sql". It is used for summarizing mails that are received. You can
look at "regendb.sh" to understand how to generate the initial empty databases.

There are some utility scripts that are not core to SEAL. I just leave them here
in case they turn out to be useful. They are small and not hard to understand.
